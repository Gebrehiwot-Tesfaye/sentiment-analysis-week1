# ðŸ“Š Financial Sentiment Analysis Project - Interim Report

## 1. Introduction

### Project Overview

This project aims to analyze financial news sentiment and its correlation with stock market movements for Nova Financial Solutions. The primary objectives are:

- Perform sentiment analysis on financial news headlines
- Analyze correlations between news sentiment and stock price movements
- Develop predictive models for market trends based on news sentiment

### Project Scope

- Analysis of financial news dataset containing headlines, publishers, dates, and stock symbols
- Integration with historical stock price data
- Implementation of technical indicators and sentiment analysis
- Development of visualization tools for insight generation

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Data Processing Pipeline

```python
# Core data processing workflow
news_data = read("../data/raw_analyst_ratings.csv")
stock_data = load_historical_data("AAPL")  # Example for Apple stock
```

### 2.2 Analysis Components

#### Sentiment Analysis

- Implemented TextBlob for headline sentiment scoring
- Categorized sentiments as positive, negative, or neutral
- Created temporal sentiment tracking system

#### Technical Analysis

- Integrated TA-Lib for technical indicators:
  - Simple Moving Average (SMA)
  - Relative Strength Index (RSI)
  - MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)

### 2.3 Current Results

#### News Analysis Statistics

- Total articles analyzed: 50,000+
- Average headline length: 73.12 characters
- Most active publishers: Top 5 identified
- Peak publication time: 10:30 AM EST

#### Technical Indicators

```python
def calculateTechnicalIndicator(stock_data):
    stock_data['SMA'] = talib.SMA(stock_data['Close'], timeperiod=20)
    stock_data['RSI'] = talib.RSI(stock_data['Close'], timeperiod=14)
    stock_data['EMA'] = talib.EMA(stock_data['Close'], timeperiod=20)
```

## 3. Challenges & Solutions

### Technical Challenges

1. **Package Installation Issues**

   - Challenge: TA-Lib installation on Windows
     ```bash
     error: Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0 or greater is required
     ```
   - Solution:
     - Initially attempted using pre-built wheels
     - Switched to alternative library pfinance for technical analysis
     - Used conda environment for better package management:
     ```bash
     conda install -c conda-forge ta-lib
     ```

2. **Kernel Compatibility**

   - Challenge: Jupyter notebook kernel issues on Windows
     - Default kernel not recognizing virtual environment
     - Package import errors in notebook
   - Solution:
     - Created new kernel specifically for project:
     ```bash
     python -m ipykernel install --user --name=venv
     ```
     - Added virtual environment to Jupyter path
     - Documented kernel setup process for team reference

3. **Data Integration**

   - Challenge: Synchronizing news and stock data timestamps
     - Different timezone formats
     - Missing data points
   - Solution:
     - Implemented timezone normalization
     - Created data validation pipeline
     ```python
     def normalize_timestamps(df):
         df['date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['date'])
         df['date'] = df['date'].dt.tz_convert('UTC')
         return df
     ```

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Challenge: Processing large datasets efficiently
     - Memory issues with large DataFrames
     - Slow calculation of technical indicators
   - Solution:
     - Implemented chunked processing
     - Added caching mechanism
     ```python
     @lru_cache(maxsize=128)
     def calculate_indicators(data_chunk):
         return process_chunk(data_chunk)
     ```

### Analytical Challenges

1. **Sentiment Analysis Accuracy**

   - Challenge: Financial terminology affecting sentiment scores
     - Standard NLP models misinterpreting financial terms
     - Ambiguous headlines
   - Solution:
     - Created custom financial dictionary
     - Implemented context-aware sentiment scoring
     ```python
     def financial_sentiment(text):
         custom_patterns = load_financial_patterns()
         return analyze_with_context(text, custom_patterns)
     ```

2. **Data Quality**
   - Challenge: Inconsistent news data format
     - Missing publisher information
     - Duplicate headlines
   - Solution:
     - Developed data cleaning pipeline
     - Implemented deduplication logic
     ```python
     def clean_news_data(df):
         df = remove_duplicates(df)
         df = fill_missing_publishers(df)
         return df
     ```

### Infrastructure Challenges

1. **Development Environment**

   - Challenge: Maintaining consistent environment across team
   - Solution:
     - Created detailed requirements.txt
     - Documented environment setup:
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

2. **Version Control**
   - Challenge: Managing large data files in git
   - Solution:
     - Implemented git-lfs for large files
     - Created .gitignore for sensitive data
     ```bash
     git lfs track "*.csv"
     git lfs track "*.pkl"
     ```
